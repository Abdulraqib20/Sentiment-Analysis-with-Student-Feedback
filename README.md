# Sentiment Analysis on Student Feedback

## Description
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of student feedback in engineering education. It is particularly directed at my engineering class in the university. It aims to gain insights from feedback data, improve education quality, and enhance the student experience. The project employs natural language processing techniques, topic modeling, and machine learning algorithms to analyze sentiments expressed by the students. It provides actionable recommendations based on sentiment analysis results.

## Key Features
- Introduction: Overview of the project.
- Data Collection: Collect student feedback data using [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeInhWFxECdegDDIYo7uY3-U-JHYyUDkTBQBw-KJxIvzYg_yA/viewform).
- Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the collected data for analysis.
- Data Preprocessing: Perform text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of specific aspects or keywords related to engineering education.
- Topic Modeling: Identify key themes and topics from the feedback data.
- Emotion Detection: Detect and analyze emotions expressed in the feedback.
- Visualizations: Generate visualizations to understand sentiment distribution and trends in the feedback.
- Conclusions

## Results and Findings
- The majority of feedback is classified as `Neutral`, followed by `Positive` and `Negative` sentiments. This indicates a diverse range of sentiments expressed by students, with a notable presence of positive and neutral sentiments. The prevalence of `Neutral` sentiments in the student feedback sentiment analysis may suggest that students are expressing a balanced perspective or a lack of strong sentiment towards their educational experience. It might also indicate that students are providing objective observations or factual statements without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.
- Majority of students had no previous experience, adding to the context of the analysis.
- Specific courses showed varying sentiment levels, suggesting strengths and areas for enhancement
- Key themes and topics were identified through topic modeling, providing additional context
- Emotion detection revealed the emotions expressed by students in their feedback
- Correlations reveal the alignment of sentiment score with overall satisfaction and perfect correlation with emotion polarity. Study hours positively influence overall satisfaction.

## Limitations and Future Work
One of the limitations of this project is the relatively small size of the dataset. The data collected for sentiment analysis on student feedback in engineering education may not represent the entire student population or provide a comprehensive view of sentiments. This limitation could affect the generalizability of the findings and the accuracy of the sentiment analysis results.

To address this limitation, future work could involve collecting a larger and more diverse dataset to improve the robustness and reliability of the sentiment analysis. Additionally, exploring external data sources or incorporating data from multiple educational institutions could provide a broader perspective on student sentiments and enhance the overall analysis.
